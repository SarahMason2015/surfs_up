<h2>Overview </h2>

<p>On a recent trip to Hawaii, the dream of owning and Surf and Shake Shop surfaced. It combines two loves, newly discovered surfing, and ice cream. Gathering all the necessary information is important in making a big decision such as this. After meeting with an investor, the topic of weather came up. In a previous venture, he didn’t take that into consideration and his dreams, and money, were washed away. In this study, we have taken data that was given to us and have been able to check out weather in Hawaii to see how well the dreams of owning our own Surf and Shake shop in Oahu.

<h2>Results </h2>

<p>Temperature matters, whether you are on vacation or looking for a place to open a business. In this case, temperature matters because the better the weather, the more people out and about, and the more people who will want to buy shakes and surf!

<h2>Summary </h2>

<p> When making a life changing decision all the facts are necessary to give you the best hope with success. Even with all the information, you can get it wrong. So, no matter how you look at it, life is always going to be a gamble. 
The information given, and once results have been tallied, leaves much to be desired. A decision shouldn’t be made with two months data. There are so many more factors that can impact a business. Since we already have the weather data, more queries could easily be performed. First, I would gather data from more months. Humidity, the amount of precipitation can also be helpful information. 

<p>Although some business will be from locals, the tourist population will drive the business. One of the most important things is to find out when tourist season is. A simple search will find that information.  Then, circle back and pull the data. That might assist in making the best decision.
